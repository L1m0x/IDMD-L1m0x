## ? FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

### Q: Will this delete the other person's messages too?
**A:** No! This tool only deletes (unsends) YOUR messages. The other person's messages will remain in the conversation.

### Q: Can the other person still see my messages?
**A:** After you unsend a message, it will disappear from both your conversation and the other person's conversation, just like using Instagram's "Unsend" feature manually.

### Q: Is this safe to use?
**A:** The tool uses Instagram's private API, which technically violates their Terms of Service. Use at your own risk. Instagram might temporarily limit your account if you delete too many messages too quickly.

### Q: How fast can I delete messages?
**A:** The tool has built-in delays (1.5 second between each deletion) to avoid triggering Instagram's spam detection. Be patient and don't try to rush it.
